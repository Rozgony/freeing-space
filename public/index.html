    <meta name="description" content="There are, always have been, and always will be spaces outside of Capitalism. Many of us have been taught to believe there are no alternatives and 
    there never have been options for a civilization beyond a small handful of forms of domination (slavery, feudalism, authoritarian state socialism, 
    capitalism, etc). This is false both historically and in the present day. Despite the current Neoliberal form of Capitalism that attempts to 
    colonize every corner of our physical and mental universe in the pursuit of profit, there are a number of spaces outside of its reach, whether newly 
    liberated or older than capitalism itself. We are here to document those spaces."/>
